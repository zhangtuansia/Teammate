# Self-hosting Zano

This guide walks you through running your own Zano server end-to-end: Supabase project, schema, web app deployment, and pointing the bridge at your own server.

## What you'll end up with

- A Supabase project (Postgres + Auth + Realtime) holding all your data.
- The Zano web app running on a host of your choice (Vercel works out of the box; anything that runs Next.js 16 will do).
- The bridge running on each machine where you want agents to live, talking to your own server instead of `zano.fehey.com`.

Total time: about 30–45 minutes for a first run.

## Prerequisites

- Node ≥ 20 and pnpm 10 locally
- A Supabase account (free tier is fine to start)
- A Vercel account (or any Next.js host of your choice)
- The repo cloned: `git clone https://github.com/EryouHao/zano.git && cd zano && pnpm install`

## 1. Create a Supabase project

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a new project.
2. Pick a strong database password and save it somewhere safe.
3. Once the project is provisioned, head to **Project Settings → API** and grab:
   - **Project URL** (looks like `https://abcdefg.supabase.co`)
   - **`anon` public key** (a long JWT)
   - **`service_role` secret key** (a long JWT — treat this like a password)

You'll use these in the next steps.

## 2. Apply the database schema

Open the **SQL Editor** in your Supabase dashboard. Run the following files **in order** (copy the contents of each file from `packages/db/src/`, paste into the SQL editor, run, then move to the next):

1. `schema.sql` — first run will fail at the `agents` table because it references `servers`. That's expected. Run it once to create `profiles` + the `handle_new_user` trigger, then continue.
2. `servers.sql` — creates `servers` and `server_members`.
3. `schema.sql` — run it again now that `servers` exists. The `profiles` block will skip (it's idempotent enough — or wrap your re-run with `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS` for the failed tables first). The remaining tables (`agents`, `channels`, `messages`, `tasks`) will create successfully.
4. `machine-keys.sql` — adds the `machine_keys` table for bridge auth.
5. `onboarding-trigger.sql` — installs the trigger that auto-creates an Onboarding Agent for every new user.
6. `fix-rls.sql` — adjusts a few RLS policies to avoid circular dependencies.

> **Note**: the schema isn't packaged as a single ordered migration yet — that's an open improvement (PRs welcome). If you hit an error mid-way, the message usually tells you exactly which table is missing.

After applying all files, verify in **Database → Tables** that you see at least: `profiles`, `servers`, `server_members`, `agents`, `channels`, `channel_members`, `messages`, `tasks`, `machine_keys`.

## 3. Configure Supabase Auth

1. **Authentication → URL Configuration**:
   - Set **Site URL** to wherever your web app will live (e.g. `https://zano.example.com` for production, `http://localhost:3000` for local dev).
   - Add the same URL to **Redirect URLs**.
2. **Authentication → Providers**:
   - **Email** is enabled by default. Decide whether you want to require email confirmation (recommended for production).
   - Optionally enable Google / GitHub / etc. if you want OAuth — Zano works with whatever Supabase Auth supports.

## 4. Run the web app locally (smoke test)

```bash
cp apps/web/.env.local.example apps/web/.env.local
```

Edit `apps/web/.env.local`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

Then:

```bash
pnpm dev:web
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`, sign up with an email, and confirm the onboarding trigger fires (you should see an "Onboarding Assistant" agent and channel appear automatically). If sign-up works and the agent appears, your DB is wired up correctly.

## 5. Deploy the web app

### Option A — Vercel (recommended)

1. Push your fork to GitHub, then import the repo into Vercel.
2. **Root directory**: leave as repo root.
3. **Framework preset**: Next.js (auto-detected).
4. **Build command**: `cd ../.. && pnpm build --filter=@zano/web` (Vercel detects pnpm workspaces, but the explicit command is the most reliable).
5. **Environment variables**:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (used by `/api/bridge/connect` to mint session JWTs — keep it secret)
6. Deploy. Update Supabase **Site URL** + **Redirect URLs** to match your Vercel deployment URL once it's live.

### Option B — anywhere else

The web app is a standard Next.js 16 app. Anything that runs Node 20+ and supports App Router will work: Render, Fly, Railway, your own VPS with `pnpm build && pnpm start`. Set the same env vars listed above.

## 6. Connect the bridge to your server

The bridge runs on each machine where you want agents to live (typically your own laptop).

### From npm (recommended)

```bash
npx @fehey/zano-bridge \
  --api-key zk_your_machine_key_here \
  --server-url https://zano.example.com
```

To get a machine API key, log into your web app, go to **Settings → Machines**, and create a new key. Copy the `npx` command shown there — it's pre-filled with your key and (if you set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL` accordingly) your server URL.

### From source

If you're hacking on the bridge:

```bash
cp apps/bridge/.env.example apps/bridge/.env
# fill in SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY, ZANO_USER_ID
pnpm dev:bridge
```

This bypasses the `--api-key` flow and connects directly with the service role key (only do this for local development — never in production).

## Bridge trust model — pick your level

The bridge is the most security-sensitive piece because it runs Claude Code on your machine with full local access. There are three ways to run it; pick based on how much you trust the published npm package.

### Option 1 — Use the published `@fehey/zano-bridge` (recommended)

This is what most self-hosters should do. Zero setup overhead, automatic bug fixes, works out of the box.

```bash
export ZANO_SERVER_URL=https://zano.example.com
npx @fehey/zano-bridge --api-key zk_your_key_here
```

**Important**: pin a specific version in production rather than tracking `latest`. This protects you against supply-chain attacks if the maintainer's npm credentials are ever compromised:

```bash
npx @fehey/zano-bridge@0.1.5 --api-key zk_your_key_here
```

You can find the latest version on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fehey/zano-bridge).

### Option 2 — Build from source

For high-trust environments (regulated workloads, security audits, air-gapped networks) or if you simply prefer running only code you've inspected. You get full source visibility and never pull binaries from npm.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EryouHao/zano.git
cd zano && pnpm install
pnpm --filter @fehey/zano-bridge build
node apps/bridge/dist/index.js \
  --api-key zk_your_key_here \
  --server-url https://zano.example.com
```

You can wrap the last command in a shell alias or a systemd unit. This is also the path to take if you want to **fork the bridge** — change `apps/bridge/package.json`'s `name` to your own scope (e.g. `@yourorg/zano-bridge`), then `npm publish` from your fork. Nothing in the server requires the bridge to be the upstream package; it's a generic client.

### Option 3 — Vendor it into your infra

For larger deployments, mirror the npm tarball into your own private registry (Verdaccio, JFrog, GitHub Packages, etc.) and install from there. Same `--server-url` flag, just a different install source. This also gives you reproducible installs even if the upstream package goes away.

### Why the bridge isn't bundled with the server

A natural question: why not just have each Zano server host its own bridge installer (`curl my-zano.com/install.sh`)? Two reasons:

1. The bridge is a **client tool** — it runs on the user's machine, not the server. Distributing it via npm means it gets the standard Node.js install/update story instead of a custom one.
2. Self-hosters don't need to maintain a build pipeline just to give their users a bridge. The same `@fehey/zano-bridge` works against any compatible Zano server.

If you'd rather not depend on the upstream package long-term, Option 2 (fork & republish) is the migration path. The server has no opinion about which bridge connects to it as long as it speaks the `/api/bridge/connect` protocol.

## 7. Verify end-to-end

1. In the web UI, your machine should appear with a green "online" dot within a few seconds of starting the bridge.
2. Your default Onboarding Agent should also show as online.
3. Send the agent a DM. It should reply within a few seconds.
4. Try creating a task in a channel and have the agent claim it (`zano task claim` runs inside the agent's Claude Code process).

If any of those steps don't work, check:

- Bridge logs (the `npx` command stays in the foreground and prints connection status)
- Supabase **Logs → Realtime** to confirm the bridge is subscribed
- Browser console for the web app

## Updating

When you pull new commits from upstream:

1. `pnpm install` to pick up dependency changes.
2. Check `packages/db/src/` for new SQL files — if any were added or changed, apply them in your Supabase project. There's no migration tooling yet; check the diff manually.
3. Redeploy the web app.
4. The published `@fehey/zano-bridge` is updated separately on npm. If you've forked the bridge, build and deploy your fork.

## Cost notes

For a small team (< 10 humans, < 20 agents, casual usage):

- **Supabase free tier** typically suffices for the database and Realtime.
- **Vercel hobby tier** is fine for the web app.
- **Anthropic API** (used by Claude Code) is the main variable cost — it scales with how much your agents talk and work.

For larger usage, expect to upgrade Supabase to Pro mainly for Realtime quotas.

## Troubleshooting

**"Invalid API key" when starting the bridge** — confirm the key was copied in full (they're long), and confirm `--server-url` points at the same server where you generated the key.

**Agent shows online but doesn't respond** — check that Claude Code is installed on the machine running the bridge (`which claude`) and that the bridge has access to your `~/.claude/` config.

**RLS errors in the web app** — if you customized the schema, double-check `fix-rls.sql` was the last thing applied. The helper function in that file is what avoids the most common circular-dependency errors.

**Onboarding agent didn't appear after signup** — the `on_profile_created` trigger from `onboarding-trigger.sql` may not have run. Check **Database → Triggers** in Supabase to confirm it exists.
